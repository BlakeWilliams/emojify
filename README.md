# E:m::o:jify

A simple Go package to turn sentences into emojified sentences. This package
probably shouldn't exist. It's like 1337 text but infinitely worse.

Here's an excerpt from The Eagle because the internet said it's a good example
text:

> He :cl::a:sps the cr:a:g with cr:o::ok:ed h:a:nds; Cl:o:se t:o: the sun in
> l:one:ly l:a:nds, Ri:ng:'d with the :a:zure w:o:rld, he st:a:nds.  The
> wrinkled se:a: :b:ene:a:th hi:m: cr:a:wls; He :watch:es fr:o::m: his
> :mountain: w:a:lls, And like :a: thunder:b::o:lt he f:a:lls.

## Usage

If you're using go modules:

```
import "github.com/blakewilliams/emojify"
```

Then `Emojify`:

```
emojify.Emojify("your text here")
```

# But why?

Meh.
